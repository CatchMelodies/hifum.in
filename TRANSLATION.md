# Please ignore this file, i will make a new one if we really add the ability to translate this website, which isn't needed yet!
# Translating

* Go to <https://hifum.in/#translator-mode>, new buttons will appear on the top-left
* Click on "Download" to get a copy of every string of text on the website
* Use an IDE such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) to edit the YAML file
* Use the "Browse..." button on hifum.in in translator mode to load your YAML file on the website to preview your changes locally
* Once you're done, send your translation to **Pizzacus#2884** on Discord, or to **/u/pizzacus** on Reddit
* Or, if you know how to use GitHub (this step is optional), fork this project to your account, clone it to your computer,
convert the YAML to JSON and add it to /src/locales and add the option for it in the index.html file around line 128, then you can do a pull request
