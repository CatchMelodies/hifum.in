# Satania: The best Waifu. Ever.

This is a website for those who wanna praise Satania, you can actually browse it at <https://satania.moe>

This repo is for the people interested in the code

## Special Thanks to
  * All the translators which are normally credited in their respective translations (unless they didn't want to)
  * Pizzacus for his beautiful website

## Translating

* Go to <https://satania.moe/#translator-mode>, new buttons will appear on the top-left
* Click on "Download" to get a copy of every string of text on the website
* Use an IDE such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) to edit the YAML file
* Use the "Browse..." button on satania.moe in translator mode to load your YAML file on the website to preview your changes locally
* Once you're done, send your translation to **Pizzacus#2884** on Discord, or to **/u/pizzacus** on Reddit
* Or, if you know how to use GitHub (this step is optional), fork this project to your account, clone it to your computer,
convert the YAML to JSON and add it to /src/locales and add the option for it in the index.html file around line 128, then you can do a pull request
